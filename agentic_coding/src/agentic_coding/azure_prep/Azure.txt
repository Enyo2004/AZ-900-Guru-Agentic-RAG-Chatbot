1.Cloud concepts
===What is cloud computing?===
Using a network in a remote server that is hosted on the internet, so that you can store, 
manage, and procees data ,rather than a local server or PC (someone else does the server job)
-someone owns the server
-someone hires the IT people
-someone pays or rents real-estate
-You configure your cloud services and code, someone else does the rest

=Evolution of cloud hosting=
1995 - Dedicated server
One Physical machine dedicated to single a business
-runs a single web-app/site
(Very expensive, high maintenance, *High security)

Virtual Private server (VPS)
One Physical machine dedicated to a single business (virtualized into submachines)
-Runs multiple web-apps/sites
(Better utilization and Isolation of resources)

Shared Hosting (GoDaddy)
One Physical machine, shared by hundred of business 
-Relies on most tenants under-utlizing their resources
(Very Cheap, limited functionality , Poor isolation)

Cloud hosting
Multiple physical machines (act as one system)
-Abstracted into multiple cloud services
(Flexible, Scalable, Secure, Cost-effective, High configurability)


==Common cloud Services==
A cloud provider can have hundreds of cloud services 
(grouped into types of services)

=Four most common types of cloud services for InfrastructureAsAService(IaaS)=

-Compute
Virtual Computer that can run application, programs and code

-Storage
Virtual hard-drive that can store files

-Networking
Virtual network being able to define internet connections or Network isolations

-Databases
Virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose web-application


==What is Microsoft?==
American multinational computer technology corporation (headquartered in Redmond, Washington)
-Makes sofware , phones, tablets, game consoles, CLOUD SERVICES, search engine
-Around since late 1970s (well known for operating system Windows)

==What is Azure==
Cloud provider service for Microsoft (CSPs = Cloud Service Provider)
Azure means "Bright blue color of the cloudless sky"

==Benefits of Cloud Computing==
-Cost effective
    You pay what you consume (no up-front cost), Pay-as-you-go(PAYG)
    thousands of customers sharing the cost of the resources

-Global
    Launch workloads anywhere in the world, just choose region

-Secure
    Cloud provider takes care of physical security.
    Can be secure by default or you can configure access down to granular level

-Reliable 
    Data backup, disaster recovery, data replication, fault tolerance

-Scalable 
    Increase or decrease recources and services based on demand

-Elastic
    Automate scaling during spikes and drop in demand

-Current 
    Hardware and managed sofware is patched ,upgraded and replaced by cloud provider 
    (without interruptions, or few interruptions)


==Types of cloud computing==
Software As A Service (SaaS)
    - Product that is run and managed by the service Provider
    (Don't need to worry about how the service is maintained, just remains available)
    -SalesForce, Gmail, Office 365

Platform As A Service (PaaS)
    - Focus on deployment and management of your apps
    (Don't worry about provisioning, configuring or understanding hardware or OS)
    - AWS Elastic Beanstalk, heroku, google app (engine)

Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS)
    -The basic building blocks for cloud IT
    (Don't worry about IT staff, data centers and data storage space)
    -Provides access to networking features, computers, and data storage space
    -Microsoft Azure, AWS, Oracle Cloud

==Types of Cloud Computing Responsibilities==
On-Premise      | IaaS              | PaaS              | SaaS

Blank space = Customer is Responsible
With name = CSP is Responsible


==Cloud Deployment Models==
Public Cloud
    -Everything built on the Cloud Provider (Cloud-Native)

Private Cloud
    -Everything built on company's datacenters (On-Premise)
    The cloud could be OpenStack

Hybrid
    -Using both (On-Premise and Cloud Service Provider)
    -It connects both through a Express Route (like fiber optic)


=Pros And Cons Deployment Models=
Public Cloud
    -Cost: Most cost-effective
    -Security: Security Controls by Default, Might not meet security requirements
    -Level of configuration: Limited based on what the CSP exposes to you
    -Technical Knowledge: You don't need depth knowledge of infrastructure


Private Cloud
    -Cost: Most expensive
    -Security: Can meet any security compliance if done well, No guarantee is secure
    -Level of configuration: You can configure it the way you like
    -Technical Knowledge: Need to know in-depth how to configure all levels

Hybrid cloud
    -Cost: Could be more cost-effective based on what you offload to the cloud
    -Security:  can meet all requirements, can meet all requirements you have to secure the connection to the cloud
    -Level of configuration: You get the best of both worlds
    -Technical Knowledge: You need to know in-depth how to configre all levels of the infrastructure and know the CSP services


=Extra Deployment Model=
-Cross cloud
    Multiple Cloud Providers (multi-cloud, hybrid-cloud)
    Amazon <-> Azure Arc(CSP) <-> GCP Kubernetes Engine


==Total cost of ownership (TCO)==

==Capital vs Operational Expenditure==

-Capital expenditure (CAPEX)
    Spending money upfront on physical infrastructure(Guess upfront money you plan to spend)
    (Deducting that expense from your tax bill over time)

    -Server costs(computers)
    -Storage costs(hard drives)
    -Network costs(Routers, Cables, Switches)
    -Backup and archive costs
    -Disaster recovery costs
    -Datacenter costs (Rent, Cooling, Physical security)
    -Technical personal


-Operational expenditure (OPEX)
    The costs associated with an on-premises datacenter shifted to the cost of CSP.
    (Customer only concerned with non-physical costs)
    Try product or service without investing in equipment

    -Leasing Software and Customizing features
    -Training Employees in Cloud services 
    -Paying for Cloud support
    -Billing based on cloud metrics
        Compute usage
        Storage usage


==Cloud architecture Terminologies==
Solutions architect
    -A role in a techical organization which architects a solution 
    using mutiple systems via RESEARCHING, DOCUMENTATION, EXPERIMENTATION

Cloud architect
    -A solutions architect focused solely on architecting solutions using cloud services

    =Cloud architect terms=
        -Availability
            Ensure services remains available (HA=Highly Available)

        -Scalability
            Ability to grow rapidly

        -Elasticity
            Ability to shrink and grow to meed demand

        -Fault tolerance
            Ability to prevent a failure

        -Disaster recovery
            Ability to recover from a failure (DR=Highly Durable)


==High availablity==
    Ability  for your service to remain available by ensuring there is
    NO SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE and/or ensure certain level of performance


    =AZURE LOAD BALANCER (Green arrows)=
        Allows you to evenly distribute traffic to multiple Servers
       
        If datacenter becomes unavailable (unhealthy) the load balacer will Route
        traffic to only available datacenters with servers


==High scalability==
    Ability to increase capacity based on the increasing demand of 
    TRAFFIC, MEMORY and COMPUTING POWER

    =Vertical scaling (Scaling up)
        Upgrade to a bigger server 

    =Horizontal Scsling (Scaling out)
        Add more servers of the same size


==High elasticity==
    Ability to increase or DECREASE your capacity based on the CURRENT  
    demand of TRAFFIC, MEMORY and COMPUTER POWER 

    =Horizontal scaling
        -Scaling out = add more servers of the same size
        -Scaling in = removing more servers of the same size

    Vertical scaling is hard for traditional architecture 
    (Usually use horizontal scaling described with elasticity)
        

    -AZURE VM SCALE SETS (Azure service)
        Automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or 
        defined schedule

    -SQL SERVER STRETCH DATABASE
        Dinamically stretch warm and cold transactional data from Microsoft 
        SQL Server 2016 to Microsoft Azure


==Fault tolerance==
    Ability for the service to ensure there is no SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE (Preventing failure)

    -Fail-over
        You have a plan to shift traffic to a redundant system in case the primary system fails 
       
        FOR EXAMPLE:
        Having a copy(secondary) of the database where the changes are synced,
        it is ONLY USED when the primary database fails (The copy becomes the primary database)

    -AZURE TRAFFIC MANAGER
        DNS-based traffic balancer:
            From -> failing primary system 
            To -> stand-by secondary system

==High Durability==
    Ability to recover from a disaster and prevent LOSS OF DATA 
    Disaster Recovery: Solution to recover from a disaster 

    QUESTION TO ASK TO EVALUATE THIS:
        -Do you have a backup?
        -How fast can you restore that backup?
        -Does the backup still work?
        -How do you ensure current live data is not corrupt?


==Business Continuity Plan (BCP)==
Document that outlines how a business will continue operating 
DURING AN UNPLANNED DISRUPTION IN SERVICES

Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
    - maximum acceptable amount of data loss after incident
    (Expressed as an amount of time)
    (How much data are you willing to lose?)

Recovery Time Objective(RTO)
    - maximum amount of downtime the business can tolerate without having 
    financial loss 
    (How much time are you willing to do down?)

==Disaster Recovery Options==

Low <-----------------------------------------------------------------> High
<--Backup and restore --- Pilot Light ----Warm Standby --- Multi-site Active/active 

Backup and restore 
    -Backup date and restore it in new infrastructure 
    (Hours)
        -Lower priority
        -Restore data after event 
        -Deploy resources after event 
        -Cost $

Pilot Light
    -Data is replicated to another region with minimal services running
    (10 minutes)
        -Less stringent RTO & RPO
        -Core services 
        -Start & scale resources after event
        -Cost $$

Warm standby 
    -Scaled down copy of infrastructure running (ready to scale up)
    (Minutes)
        -Business critical services
        -Scale resources after event 
        -Cost $$$

Multi-site Active/active
    -Scaled up copy of your infrastructure in another region
    (Real time)
        -Zero downtime
        -Near zero loss
        -Mission critical services 
        -Cost $$$$ (Basically the cost of the whole infrastructure)


2.Evolution of Compute
==Dedicated Services==
    -physical server WHOLLY UTILIZED BY A SINGLE CUSTOMER 
        -Guess the capacity, overpay for unitilized server 
        -Upgrading beyond capacity will be slow and expensive
        -Limited by the Operating System (OS)
        -Multiple apps can result in conflicts (resource sharing)
        -Guarantee of security, privacy and full utility of underlying resources 


==Virtual Machines (VMs)==
    -Run multiple virtual machines on one machine 
        -Hypervisor (software layer that lets you the VMs)
        -physical server shared  by multiple customers 
        -Pay fraction of server 
        -Overpay for inutilized Virtual machine 
        -Limited by Guest operating system 
        -Multiple apps on a single Virtual machine can result in conflics(resource sharing)
   
==Containers==
    -Virtual machines running multiple containers 
    -Docker Deamon(name of software layer that lets you run multiple containers)
    -Maximum the utilize of the available capacity (more cost-effective)
    -Containers share the same OS (more efficient than multiple VMs)
    -Mutltiple apps run side by side without being limited to the same OS
    -NO CONFLICTS (Resource sharing)

==Functions==
    -Managed VMs running managed containers 
    -Known as SERVERLESS COMPUTE 
    -Upload piece of code, choose amount of memory and duration
    -You are Responsible for ONLY code and data 
    -Very cost effective (only pay for the time code is running)
        -VMs only run when there is code in it 
        -Cold Starts is a side-effect of this setup 


3.Global infrastructure
==Regions and Geographies==

Region
    -Grouping of multiple datacenters (Availability zones)

    --Azure has 58 regions available across 140 countries--

Geography

    DATA RESIDENCY and COMPLIANCE BOUNDARIES

=Azure geographies=
    -United states
    -Azure Government(US)
    -Canada
    -Brazil
    -Mexico
    
==Paired Regions==
-Each Region is paired with another region 300 MILES AWAY
-One region updated at a time(ENSURE NO OUTAGES)
-Some AZURE services rely on Paired regions for DISASTER RECOVERY 

AZURE GEO-REDUNDANT STORAGE (GRS)
    -Replicates data to a secondary region Automatically
    (ensuring data is durable even when primary region isn't recoverable)


==Region Types and Service Availability==
(Not all Cloud services available in every Region)

Recommended Region
    -Region that provides broadest range of service capabilities
    DESIGNED TO SUPPORT AVAILABILITY ZONES now or in the future

Alternate (other) Region 
    -Region that extends Azure's footprints within a data residency boundary
    (Not designed to support AZ's=Availability Zones) 
    They are labeled as OTHER in the Azure Portal

=General Availability (GA)=
    -Service considered ready to be used publicly by everyone

Azure Cloud services are grouped into three categories:
(Category determines when cloud services become available)

    -Foundational
        When GA, immediately or in 12 months (Recommended or Alternate Region)

    -Mainstream
        When GA, immediately or in 12 months (Recommended)
        (May become available in Alternate Regions -> based in customer demand)

    -Specialized
        Available in Recommended or Alternate regions based in customer demand 

==Special regions==
    To meet compliance or legal reasons 
    
    United States
        -US DoD Central

        -China North 
        (Available throgh Microsoft(Does not maintain those servers) and 21Vianet)

==Availability Zones (AZ)==
    Physical location made up of one or more datacenter

    Datacenter(Secured building that contains hundred of thousands of computers)
    
    A region will generally contain 3 AVAILABILITY ZONES
    (Isolated from each other (different buildings) but close enough for low latency)

    =High availability=
    Run workloads in 3 AZs to ensure services remain available(in case one of them fails)
    

==AZs supported Regions==
    Not every region has support for AZs(ALTERNATE OR OTHER)
    Recommended regions are suppose to have at least 3 AZs 

    -Minimum of 3 AZS-
        Central US
        East US 2
        West US 2
        West Europe
        France Central 
        North Europe 
        Southeast Asia 

==Availability Sets Fault and update domains==
    AZs in an Azure Region 
    -Combination of FAULT DOMAIN and UPDATE DOMAIN 

    -Fault Domain 
        Logical grouping of hardware to avoid single point of failure within an AZ 
        VMs grouped that share common power source and network switch 

    -Update Domain 
        Azure may need to apply udpated to hardware and software 
        Ensure your resources do not go offline 

    -Availability set 
        Logical grouping to ensure that VMs you place in the availabiliy set
        are different fault/update domains to avoid downtime

4. Compute services

    Virtualization (run a server WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY AND MAINTAIN PHYSICAL HARDWARE )

    -Virtual machines maintenance 
        Applying OS system patches 
        Installing and configuring packages 

    -Things to know
        -The size of the virtual machine is determined by the IMAGE 
            Image(combination of vCPU's, Memory, and Storage capacity)

        -Current limit on a per Subscription is 20 VMs per region 
        (VMs billed at an hourly rate)

        -A Single instance VMs has availability of 99.9% (when premium storage disks)

        -Two instances deployed in Availability set gives you 99.95% availability 
        
        -Attach multiple Managed disk to AZURE VMs 

    =Components created or associated to VIRTUAL MACHINE when launched=

==AZURE SCALE SETS==
    AUTOMATICALLY increase or decrease your VM capacity 

    -Create Scalling policies to add or remove based on Host metrics 
    -Create Health checks and set a Repair Policy to replace unhealthy instances
    -Associate a LOAD BALANCEER to distribute VMs accross AZs
    -You can scale to 100s or even 1000s of VMs using scale sets 
    
    SCALE SETS
        -Group of identical VMs (same image and size)

==AZURE LOAD BALANCER==
(Associated with a Scale set)
    allow you to:
        -evenly distribute VMs accross multiple AZs to make the app HIGHLY AVAILABLE 
        
        -Use load Balancer probe checks (Robust Health Check)
            2 load balancers:

                1.Application gateway: 
                    -HTTP/HTTPS web traffic load balancer with URL-based routing,
                    SSL termination, session persistence, web application firewall 

                2.AZURE load balancer: 
                    -Supports all TCP/UDP network traffic,port-forwarding, and outbound flows

==Scaling Policy==
    Determine when a VMs should be addes or removed to meet current capacity requirements 

    Scale out
        -When an instance should be ADDED to the Scale Set to INCREASE capacity
        (When CPU threshold (%) greater than X for Y minutes add X servers)

    Scale In
        -When an instance should be REMOVED to the Scale set to DECREASE capacity
        (When CPU threshold (%) less than X for Y minutes add X servers)

            ROLLING 
                Upgrades roll out in batches with optional pause
            
        =Automatic OS upgrades=
            Helps to ease update management by safely and AUTOMATICALLY  
            upgrading the OS disk for all instances


==Health monitoring==
    -enabled to determine if server is HEALTHY or UNHEALTHY 

    2 modes:
        -Application Health extension 
            Ping an HTTP request to specific path, and except status 200
        -Load Balancer Probe   
            Allow to check based on TCP, UDP or HTTP requests 
        

        --Automatic Repair Policy--
            If unhealthy instance:
                then DELETE it and LAUNCH new instance 

==Azure Virtual Desktop==
    -DESKTOP AND APP VIRTUALIZATION service that runs on the cloud 

    Works accross devices (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux) 
    with apps that you can use to access remote dektops and apps.


    Used for specific needs like when SECURITY is a concern 
    because all data is SAVED ON THE SERVER and cannot be left on the
    DEVICE OF THE USER


    =Advantages=

        -Enable secure and productive remote work on any device 
        (Provides full windows 10 and Windows Server desktop
        and application virtualization on any personal device)

        -Reduce costs of licensing and infrastructure 
        (Integration with Microsoft 365 apps for enterprises and MS Teams)

        -Protect against outages (stay productive)
        (Keep team running during outages by leveraging built-in 
        AZURE SITE RECOVERY and AZURE BACKUP technologies)

        -Simplify IT management 
        (Windows Virtual Desktop mangages the virtual desktop infrastructure
        -> you can focus on users, apps, and OS images instead of hardware and maintenance)

        -Keep application and user data secure
        (applying right access controls to users and devices with 
        AZURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY CONDITIONAL ACCESS)


5. Azure App Service

==Azure App service==
    -Quickly DEPLOY AND MANAGE WEB APPS on Azure (without worrying of infrastrucutre)
    (Known as PaaS(Platform as a Service))

     HTTP BASED-SERVICE for hosting web applications, Rest APIs, and mobile backends
     (It is the Heroku of Azure)

     =Azure app service takes care of=
        -Security Patches for OS and languages
        -Load balancing
        -Autoscaling
        -Automated manager

    = Integrations and features =
        -Azure DevOps (DEPLOYMENTS)
        -Github Integration
        -Docker Hub integration 
        -Package management 
        -Easy to setup starting environments 
        -Custom domains
        -Attaching TLS/SSL certificates

    =Pay based on Azure app service plan=
        -Shared Tier:
            Free, shared (linux not supported)

        -Dedicated Tier:
            Basic, standard , premium, premiumV2 , premiumV3

        -Isolated Tier:
            
            (Azure App Services can also run dockers single mutli containers)


==Runtimes==

Runtime Environments 
    -Runtime software/Instructions that are executed 
    WHILE your program is running 

Runtime (Generally)
    -What programming language and libraries and framework you are using 

Runtime (Azure App Services)
    -Predefined Container that has your programming language 
    and commonly used library for that language installed 

    =Choose a runtime=
        -.NET 
        -.NET Core 
        -Java 
        -Ruby
        -Node.js 
        -PHP 
        -Python

    (CSPs will usually stop supporting older versions 
    to enforce customers to keep good security practices 
    by having latest patches) 

==Custom containers==
    -to use different runtimes or bundle in a packages or software 

    !.Create own DOCKER container on local environment 
    2.Push the docker container to AZURE CONTAINER REGISTRY 
    3.DEPLOY your container image to APP SERVICE 


==Deployment Slots==
    -Create DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS of your web-application 
    associated to a different hostname (useful when staging, or QA environment)

    (A way to quickly clone production environment for other uses)

    You can SWAP environments (this could be how you perform a Blue/Green deploy)

    Promote staging to production by swapping (if something goes wrong you can swap back)

    Blue/green deployment: 
        -swap the environment with current production 
        and retire the current production 


==App Service environment (ASE)==
    -Azure App Service feature that provides 
    FULLY ISOLATED AND DEDICATED ENVIRONMENT
    for securely running App Service apps at high scale

    Allows to host:
        -Windows web apps 
        -Linux Web apps 
        -Docker containers 
        -Mobile apps 
        -Functions 

    Appropiate for application workloads that require:
        -High scale 
        -Isolation and secure network access 
        -High memory utilization 

    Customers can create multiple ASEs within a region or multiple regions 
    (ideal for HORIZONTAL SCALING STATELESS APPLICATION TIERS 
    in support of HIGH REQUESTS PER SECOND (RPS) WORKLOADS)

    -ASE comes with its own pricing tier (Isolate Tier)
    -ASEs can be used to configure security architecture 
    -Apps running on ASEs can have their access gated by upstream devices(WEB APPLICATION FIREWALLS (WAFs))
    -App Service Environments can be deployed into AZ using Zone pinning

        =2 deployment types for ASE=
            1.External 
                -Exposes the ASE-Hosted apps on an internet-accessible IP address 

                (If the VNet is connected to the On-premise network, apps in the ASE
                have access to resources there without additional configuration)

                (Because the ASE is within the VNet , it can also access resources 
                within the VNet without additional configuration)
            

            2.ILB (Internal Load Balancer) ASE
                -ILB exposes the ASE-Hosted apps on an IP addres inside your VNet
                (Internal endpoint is an INTERNAL LOAD BALANCER(ILB))


==Azure App Service Plan==
    -Defines HOW MUCH YOU PAY AND WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE 
        
        3 pricing tiers for APP SERVICE PLAN:
        
        =DEV/Test Tab=
            =Shared Tiers(2)
                -FREE 
                    -1 GB of disk space 
                    -Up to 10 apps on a single shared instance 
                    -NO SLA for availabilty 
                    -Each app has a compute quota of 60 minutes per day

                -SHARED(does not support LINUX)
                    -Up to 100 apps on a single shared instance 
                    -NO SLA for availability
                    -Each app has a compute quota of 240 minutes per day

            =Dedicated Tiers(5)

                -Basic
                    -More disk space 
                    -unlimited apps 
                    -3 levels in this tier that offer varying amounts of compute power, memory, disk storage 


            =Production Tab=
                -Standard 
                    -Scale out to three dedicated instances 
                    -SLA of 99.95% Availability 
                    -3 levels in this tier offering amounts of: 
                        -Compute Power 
                        -memory 
                        -disk storage 

                -Premium 
                    -scale to 10 dedicated instances 
                    -availability SLA of 99.95%
                    -multiple levels of hardware


            =Isolated Tab=
                =Isolated Tier 
                    -dedicated Azure virtual Network 
                    -full netword and compute isolation 
                    -scale out to 100 instances 
                    -availability SLA of 99.95%


6. Azure Container Instances

==Introduction to ACI==
    -PACKAGE, MANAGE, DEPLOY cloud applications using CONTAINERS 
    (Fully managed DOCKER AS A SERVICE)

    -Allow you to LAUNCH CONTAINERS without the need to worry about 
    configuring or managing the underlying virtual machine

    -Designed for isolate containers:
        -simple applications 
        -task automation 
        -build jobs 

    =Why CONTAINERS ARE BETTER OPTION THAN VMs=
        -containers provisioned in seconds , VMs in minutes 
        -containers biled per second ,VMs billed per hour (greater savings)
        -containers GRANULAR AND CUSTOM SIZING OF vCPUs, Memory, and GPUs , VMS sizes are predetermined
        -ACI can deploy both Windows and Linux containers
        -PERSIST STORAGE WITH AZURE FILES for your ACI containers 
        -ACIs are accessed via fully qualified domain name (FQDN) -> eg. customlabel.azureregion.azurecontainer.io.
        
        Azure provides Quickstart images to start launching example applications but can also source from:
            -AZURE CONTAINER REGISTRY 
            -DOCKER HUB 
            -PRIVATELY HOSTED CONTAINER REGISTRY 

    =Container groups=
        -collection of containers that get scheduled on the same host machine 

        Group share:
            -lifecycle 
            -resources 
            -local Network
            -storage volumes
        
        CONTAINER GROUPS are similar to KUBERNETES POD 

        Multi-container groups only support Linux containers currently 

        =Two ways to deploy a multi-container group:
            -Resource Manager Template(ARM template):
                deploy additional Azure services resources 

            -YAML file :
                deployment includes only container instances 

==Container Restart Policies==
    -specifies what a container should do when their process has completed

    3 restart-policiy options:
        -ALWAYS(default):
            containers are ALWAYS RESTARTED.
            For long running tasks (web-servers)

        -NEVER:
            Containers RUN ONLY ONE TIME.
            One off tasks (background jobs)

        -ONFAILURE:
            Containers that encounter an error



==Container Environment Variables==
    Environment Variables (Env Vars) allow to pass configuration details to containers 
    (Set via Azure Portal, CLI or PowerShell)

    SECURED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES 
        -use the "--secure-environment-variables" flag



==Container Persistent Storage==
    -Azure containers are STATELESS by default 
    (When container crashes or stops all state is loss)

    -To PERSIST STATE need to MOUNT external volume such as:
        -Azure files (file share)
        -Secret volume 
        -Empty directory 
        -Cloud git repo 

        Mount a volume via PowerShell or CLI and specify DETAILS to mount the drive 


7. Virtual Networking 

==Introduction to Virtual Networks (vNet)==
    -Logically isolated section of the Azure Network 
    where you launch your Azure resources 


    =Azure DNS=
        Manage your own DNS domain 

    =Virtual Network (vNET)=
        logically isolated section of Azure Networkd 
            -Address spaces 
            -Route tables 
            -Subnets 

    =Network Security Groups=
        Virtual firewall at the subnet or NIC level 

    =ExpressRoute=
        50 Mbps - 10 Gbps connecion between On-premise to Vnet 

    =Virtual WAN=
        centralized network to route different network connections

    =Virtual Network Gateway=
        site-to-site VPN connection between an Vnet and local networks 

    =Network Interfaces

    -connect multiple VNet so they act as one network 

    =2 types of VNet peering=
        
        -Regional VNet Peering 
            Peer two Vnets from the same region 

        -Global VNet Peering 
            Peer two Vnets from two different regions 


==Network interfaces==

    =Network interface=
        -SOFTWARE OR SOFTWARE between two pieces of equipment or protocol layers in a computer network 

    =NIC=
        -COMPUTER HARDWARE COMPONENT that connects computer to computer network

        Known as:
            -network interface card 
            -network adapter
            -LAN adapter 
            -physical network interface 

        --COMMUNICATE USING INTERNET PROTOCOLS (IP)--
            Devices for:
                Data link layer (Layer 2)
                Physical layer (layer 1)

        =AZURE NETWORK INTERFACES=
            attached to Azure VM instance (without NIC the VM instance has no way to communicate)
            =Azure VM instance can have multiple NICs=


==Subnets==
    -LOGICAL DIVISION OF AN ADDRESS SPACE which help you 
    DEFINE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORKLOADS and allow to apply virtual isolation within network 

    Azure resource -> choose the subnet you want to launch -> IP from that subnet is assigned to resource 

    =Associating a route table=
        -subnet needs a Route table so it can access

    
    =Public Vs Private Subnet=
        -describes whether a subnet is reachable from the internet or not 
            (Azure has no concepts of private and public subnets)

         Configure subnets to ensure they dont reach the internet:
            -NO route via their route table to the Internet Gateway    
    

    =Associating Network Security Gateways (NSG)
        -associate an NSG to:

            -protect traffic entering and leaving subnet by:

                -applying security rules that can ALLOW or DENY access based 
                    
                    -IP address
                    -Port 
                    -Protocol 


    =Gateway Subnet=
        Azure special type of gateway subnet used by AZURE VIRTUAL NETWORK GATEWAY and that 
        service launches specialized VMs into that subnet 
    

==Azure DNS==
    -Hosting service for DNS DOMAINS that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure

    =DNs (Domain Name System)=
        -Service responsible for translating (or resolving) SERVICE NAME to its IP ADDRESS 

    
        =Public DNS (internet facing)=
            -Manage domains for INTERNET accessible domains 
                -Pointing domain to website
                -Setting records to prove you own the domain
                -Records to connect the domain to email server

        =Private DNS (internal facing)=
            -allows to use own custom domains instead of Azure provided domains 
                -Azure services use FULL QUAILIFIED DOMAIN NAME(FQDN) to identify services on the network

                (CANT USE AZURE DNS TO BUY A DOMAIN NAME) -> Purhcase through App services or Third-party provider and have Azure DNS manager


==Virtual Private Network==
    -EXTENDS A PRIVATE NETWORK ACCROSS A PUBLIC NETWORK 
    and enables users to SEND AND RECEIVE DATA ACROSS 
    SHARED OR PUBLIC NETWORKS as if their computing devices 
    where connected to the private network
    

    =Virtual Network Gateway=
        -software VPN device for your Azure Virtual network 
        -When you deploy two or specialized VMs in specific subnet you need to create called a "Gateway subnet"
        -VMs contain routing tables and run specific gateway services 
        -Choose GATEWAY TYPES : determine if is VPN GATEWAY or EXPRESSROUTE GATEWAY 


==Azure Express Routes==
    -Create PRIVATE CONNECTIONS between azure datacenters 
    and infrastructure on your premises or colocation environment 

    -They don't go in public internet so they offer:
        -more reliability 
        -faster speeds
        -consistent latencies 
        -higher security

    -Conectivity can be from:
        any to any (IP VPN) network
        point to point ethernet network 
        Virtual crosss-connection 
    Through a connectivity provider at a colocation facility 


    =Express route direct= 
        -allows GREATER BANDWIDTH CONNECTIONS from 50 Mbps to 10 Gbps 
        (Ideal where for hybrid soltions with massive amount of DATA and LATECNY matters)

==Private Links==
    -ESTABLISH SECURE CONNECTIONS between Azure resources so traffic REMAINS WITHIN THE AZURE NETWORK

    =PRIVATE LINK ENDPOINT is a NETWORK INTERFACE that connects privately 
    and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link.
    (Uses private IP address from Vnet) 

    =Azure Services that work with Private link:
        -Azure storage
        -CosmoDB
        -SQL

    =PRIVATE LINK SERVICE allows to connect own workload to Private Link.
    (Need AZURE STANDARD INTERNAL LOAD BALANCER and associate it with the link service)

8.Storage Accounts

            ,good for writing and reading large amounts of data that is close together)
            -Varied performance based on access tier (Hot, cool, archive)
            
            -Use cases:
                -Backup and disaster recovery 
                -Media content 
                -Bulk data processing 


        -Premium
            -Stored on SSDs (SSD have no moving parts and data is distributed randomly -> That is why it reads and writes so fast )
            -Optimize low latency 
            -Higher throughput 

            -Use cases:
                -Interactive workloads 
                -Analytics 
                -AI or ML 
                -Data transformation 


==Access Tiers==
    - 3 types of access tiers for STANDARD STORAGE
        (Blob storage)
        -Hot 
            -Data accessed frequently
            -Highest storage cost, lowest access cost 
            
            Use case:
                Active use or expected to be accessed frequently
                Data staged for proccesing and eventual migration to the cool access tier

        -Cool
            -Data that's infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 Days 
            -Lower storage cost, higher access cost

                Use case:
                    Short-term backup disaster recovery datasets
                    Older media content not viewed frequently anymore but expected available immediately when accessed
                    Large data sets that need to be stored cost effectively while more data is being gathered for future processing
        -Archive
            -Rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days 
            -Lowest storage cost, highest acesss cost 
            


        ACCOUNT LEVEL TIERING 
            -Blob that does'nt have assigned tier infers the tier from the Storage Account access tier setting 
            
        BLOB-LEVEL TIERING
            -Upload a blob to the tier of choice 
            (Changing tiers happens instantly except moving OUT OF ARCHIVE)

        REHYDRATING A BLOB 
            -Moving a blob out of archive takes HOURS (REHYDRATING)

        BLOB LIFECYBLE MANAGEMENT 
            -Create rule-based policies to transition data to different tiers 
            (Eg. After 30 days move to Cool storage)

        

        =Moving from a Cooler tier:
            -Operation is billed as a WRITE OPERATION to destination tier 
            -Where the write operation (per 10,000) and data write (per GB) charges of the destination tier apply


        =Moving from a Hotter tier:
            -Operation is billed as a read from the source tier
            -Where the READ OPERATION (per 10,000) and data retrieval (per GB) charges of the source tier apply
            -Early deletion charges for any blob moved out of the cool or archive tier may apply as well

        
    =Cool and archive deletion=
        -Any blob that is moved into cool tier(GPV2 accounts only) is subject to cool early deletion period of 30 days 
        -Any blob that is moved into the archive tier is subject to an archive early deletion period of 180 days(Charge is prorated)


==Replication and data redundancy==
    -Stored multiple copies of the data so that is protected from:
        -planned events 
        -transient hardware failures 
        -network power outages 
        -massive natural disasters 

        (The GREATER LEVEL OF REDUNDANCY the more EXPENSIVE the cost of replication)


    NEED TO CHOOSE REPLICATION TYPE:
        =Primary Region redundancy  -> Disaster Recovery and Failovers
            -Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
                -Copies data SYNCHRONOUSLY in primary region
                -99.99999999999% (11 nines) durability
                -CHEAPEST OPTION

            -Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
                -Copies data SYNCHRONOUSLY across 3 AZs in primary region
                -99.999999999999 (12 nines) durability

        =Secondary Region Redundancy -> Disaster Recovery and Failovers (More recovery)
                -Replicate to a secondary region in case of primary regional disaster
                -The secondary region is determined based on your primary's pair region
                -Secondary region isn't available for read or write access (Except in event of FAILOVER)

                    -Geo redundant storage (GRS)
                        -Copies data SYNCHRONOUSLY (guaranteed) in primary region 
                        -Copies data ASYNCHROUNOUSLY (not guaranteed) to another region
                        -99.9999999999999999 (16 nines) of durability 

                    -Geo zone redundant storage (GZRS)
                        -Copies data SYNCHRONOUSLY accross 3 AZs in a physical region 
                        -Copies data ASYNCHROUNOUSLY to another region 
                        -99.9999999999999999 (16 nines) of durability 


        =Secondary Region Redundancy with READ ACCESS -> Read Replicas
            -Data is replicated SYNCHRONOUSLY to primary region 
            -Data will be "in-sync" with your primary and you'll have READ ACCESS

                -Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)
                    -Copies data SYNCHRONOUSLY in primary region 
                    -Copies data SYNCHRONOUSLY to another region
                    -99.9999999999999999 (16 nines) of durability 

                -Read access geo zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)
                    -Copies data SYNCHRONOUSLY accross 3 AZs in a physical region 
                    -Copies data SYNCHRONOUSLY to another region 
                    -99.9999999999999999 (16 nines) of durability 

==Introduction to AZURE BLOB==
    -OBJECT STORAGE optimized for STORING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF UNSTRUCTURED DATA 

    (UNSTRUCTURED DATA is data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as TEXT OR BINARY)
        
    =Composed of components=
        -Storage Account-
            Unique namespace in AZURE for your data 

        -Containers-
            Similar to a folder in a file system 

        -Blobs-
            Actual data being stored 


=Azure Blob Types=
    3 types of BLOB:
        -BLOCK BLOBS:
            -Store text and binary data 
            -Made up of blocks of data that can be managed individually 
            -Store up to about 4.75 TB of data 


        -APPEND BLOBS:
            -Optimized for append Operations
            -Ideal for scenarios such as LOGGING DATA from Virtual Machine


        -PAGE BLOBS:
            -Store random access files up to 8 TB in size 
            -Store virtual hard drive (VHD) files and serve as disks for Azure Virtual Machine

=AZ Copy=
    -COMMAND UTILITY that you can use to copy BLOBS OR FILES to or from a storage account

    1.Executable File you download 
    
    2.Need to have level of authorization via attach roles 
        -To download:
            Storage Blob Data Reader 

        -To upload:
            Storage Blob data Contributor
            Storage Blob data Owner 

    3. Gain access either via:
        -Azure Active Directory (AD)
        -Shared Access signature (SAS)

    4.Use COPY COMMAND to UPLOAD and DOWNLOAD
        

==Azure Storage Explorer==
    -STANDALONE APP that makes it easy to work with Azure Storage data on WINDOWS, macOS, and LINUX.
    (Create Blob Containers, upload files, create snapshots of disk, and more)

    

==Introduction to Azure files==
    -Fully managed FILE SHARE in the cloud
    
    FILE SHARE - CENTRALIZED SERVER FOR STORAGE that allows MULTIPLE CONNECTIONS 
    (Having one big shared drive that everyone (Virtual Machines) can work on at the same time)
    
    To Connect to the file share a NETWORK PROTOCOL you use:
        -Server Message Block (SMB)
        -Network File System (NFS)

    When the connection is established the "file share's filesystem 
    will be accessible in the specific directory within your own directory tree" (known as MOUNTING) 


==Azure FIles Use Cases==
    -Completely REPLACE or SUPPLEMENT  On-premsises file servers Network Attach Storage (NAS) devices
    
    -LIFT AND SHIFT your On-premise storage to the cloud via Classic Lift or Hybrid Lift
        Lift and shift: move workloads without rearchitecting (importing local VMs to the cloud)
        
        -Classic Lift:
            Where both the application and its data are moved to Azure 

        -Hybrid lift:
            Where the application data is moved to Azure files (APPLICATION continues to run on-premises)

    -Simplify cloud development 
        -Shared application settings:
            Multiple VMs and developer workstations need to access the same config files

        -Diagnostic Share:
            All VMs log to the file share, developers can mount and debug all logs in a centralized place 

        -Dev/Test/Debug:
            Quickly share tools for developer needed for local environments 

    -Containerization 
        Use Azure Files to persist volumes for stateful containers 


    Why use AZURE FILES instead of setting own FILE SHARE SERVER?
        -Shared Access:
            Alrady setup to work with standard networking protocols SMB and NFS 

        -Fully managed:
            Its kept up to date with security patches (designed to scale)

        -Scripting and Tooling:
            Automate the management and creation of file shared with AZURE API and POWERSHELL 

        -Resiliency:
            Build to be durable and always working 

==Azure File Sync==
    Service that allows you to CACHE Azure FIles share on an 
    ON PREMISES WINDOWS SERVER or CLOUD VM

    -Can use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access data locally (SMB, NFS, FTPS)
    -Can have as many caches as you need to accross the world

            -shared folders 

    -Group Policy Object (GPO)
        -Virtual collection of policy settings (controls what ADs have access to)

    -Organization Units (OU)
        Subdivision within an Active Directory into which you can place 
            -users
            -groups     
            -computers
            -other organizational units 

    -Directory Service (Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)) -> Runs on a Domain Controller
        Provides the methods for storing directory data and 
        making this data available to network users and administrators 


==AD DS (Microsoft Entra Domain Services)==
    When doing LIFT-and-Shift from On-premise to Microsoft Azure and migrating Active Directory
    Azure does not support some DOMAIN SERVICES 


    AZURE ACITVE DIRECTORY DOMAIN SERVCES (AD DS) provides MANAGEDE DOMAIN SERVICE such as:
        -Domain joins
        -Group policies 
        -Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP)
        -Kerberos / NTLM authentication 

    You can use them without the need to:
        -deploy , manage and patch domain controllers (DCs) in the cloud 


==Single Sign-on (SSO) in Entra ID==
    -Feature that allows users to AUTHENTICATE ONCE with Azure AD and then 
    ACCESS MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES WITHOUT HAVING TO AUTHENTICATE AGAIN

    When user signs intro Entra ID with credentials, Entra ID creates a SECURITY TOKEN 
    that can be used to access other RESOURCES within the same organization 
        -Token can be used to authenticate the user to other cloud-based or On-premises applications 
        that have been intregated with Entra ID

    SSO supports multiple apps like:
        Cloud based:
            -Microsoft 365
            -SalesForce 
            -Dropbox 

        On-Premises:
            -SharePoint
            -SAP

    SSO can also be used with custom-built applications using industry-standard protocols such as:
        -SAML
        -OpenID Connect 
        -OAuth

    Choosing an SSO method depends on how the application is configured for authentication
        -Cloud applications can use 
            -OpenID, 
            -Connect, 
            -OAuth, 
            -SAML, 
            -password-based,
            -linked for SSO 
        (SSO can also be disabled)

        -On-premises applications can use
            -password-based,
            -Integrated Windows,
            -Authentication, 
            -Header-based,
            -linked for SSO
        The ON-premises choices work then applications are configured for APPLICATION PROXY

    Main SSO Protocols supported in Azure:

        -Open ID and OAuth:
            OpenID Connect is an identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0
            Allows for authentication and authorization of users in a secure and standardized mannner
            (Used for WEB AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS)

        -SAML(Security Assertion Markup Language):
            XML based protocol used for exchanging authentication and authorization data between
            and identity provider and a service provicer
            (Used for FEDERATED authentication scenarios)

        -Password-based authentication:
            Traditional username/password authentication method where users provice their credentials 
            directly to authenticate

        -Linked authentication:
            Ability to link multiple accounts from a different identity providers to a single
            user identity.
            (Allows users to authenticate using any of their linked accounts)

        -Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA):
            Users access applications using their Windows domain credentials, utilizing their 
            CURRENT WINDOWS SESSION for authentication 

        -Header Based authentication:
            The application accepts an authentication token in the form of a header in each 
            request 
            (Token validated by the application to authenticate the user)

    =Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)=
        -Security control where after you fill your username/email and password
        YOU HAVE TO USE A SECOND DEVICE such as Phone to confirm that you're logging in
        (Protects against people who stole the PASSWORD)

==External Identities==
    -Allow people outside your organization to access your apps and resources
    (Sign with whatever identity they prefer)

        -Partners, distributos, suppliers, vendors, and other guests users can 
        BRING THEIR OWN IDENTITIES (Supports Google and Facebook logins)

        -Share apps with external users (B2B collaboration)
        -Develop apps intended for other AzureAD Tenants (Single-tenant or multi-tenant)
        -Develop white-labeled apps for consumers and customers (Azure AD B2C)    

==Conditional Access==
    -Provides extra layer of security before allowing authenticated users to access data or other assets 

    -Implemented via CONDITIONAL ACCESS POLIICES 
    (Set of rules that specify the CONDITIONS under which sign-ins are EVALUATED and ALLOWED)

    Ex:
        if the user account name is a member of a group for users that are assigned the 
            EXCHANGE, USER, PASSWORD, SECURITY, SHAREPOINT , OR GLOBAL ADMINISTRATOR ROLES:
                Require MFA before allowing access

            (Policy enables MFA enforcement based on group membership, 
            simplifiying the process compared to configuring MFA 
            for individual users when roles change)
    

    -Conditional access analyzes:
        -Signals 
            -User and location 
            -Device 
            -Application 
            -Real time risk 

        -Verifies every access attempt via ACCESS CONTROLS 
            -Requires MFA 
            -Allow Access
            -Block Access

    =Signals=
        Metadata associated with an identity attempting to gain access

        -User or group membership
            Policies targer specific users and groups (including admin roles),
            giving admins fine-grained control over access 

        -Named location information/IP location information 
            Ip address ranges are used to permite or deny access (geographical locations) 

        -Device 
            Policies can be applied based on the platform or status of a user's device 

        -Application 
            Users attempting to access specific applications can trigger different Conditional Access Policies 

        -Real time sign-in risk detection
            Sigals in Azure AD identity protection detect risky sign-ins 
            IF risk emerge , policies can prompt actions such as
                -Password requests
                -Multifactor authentication 
                -Block access pending adming intervention 

        -Cloud apps or actions 
            Can include or exclude cloud applications or user actions that will be subject to the policy 

        -User risk 
            -Customers with Identity protection, user risk can be evaluated as part of a Conditionnsl Access Policy
            -User risk represents the probability that a given identity or account is compromised 

    =Common desicions=
        Define access controls THAT DECIDE WHAT LEVEL OF ACCESS based on signal information

        -Block access:
            Most restrictive decision 

        -Grant access:
            Least restrictive decision, still require one or more of the following:
                -Requiere multi-factor authentication 
                -Require device to be marked as compliant 
                -Require Hybrid Azure AD joined device 
                -Require approved client app
                -Require app protection policy (preview)
        
        Can use CONDITIONAL ACCESS POLICIES IN:
            -Microsoft 365 Business Premium 
            -Microsoft 365 E3 and E5
            -Azure AD Premium P1 
            -Azure AD Premium P2 licenses


11.Security
    
=Zero Trust model==
    "TRUST NO ONE, VERIFY EVERYTHING"

        Malicious actors being able to by-pass conventional ACCESS CONTROLS 
        demonstrates traditional security measures are no long sufficient

    =MICROSOFT'S ZERO TRUST MODEL=
        3 Principles:
            1.Verify Explicitly 
            2.Least Privileged Access 
            3.Assume Breach

        6 pillars:
            -Identities (emphasis on this one)
            -Endpoints (Devices)
            -Apps 
            -Data 
            -Infrastructure 
            -Network

==Zero trust principles==

    -Verify Explicitly 
        Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points

    -Least privileged access / Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)
        Limit user access with JUST-IN-TIME and JUST-ENOUGH-ACCESS (JIT/JEA),
        risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection


    -Assume breach 
        Minimize blast radius and segment access.
        Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, 
        drive threat detection, improve defenses

==Defense In-depth Model==

    =7 Layers of security=
    1.Data 
        Accss to business and customer data, encryption to protect data 

    2.Application 
        Applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities 

    3.Compute
        Access to virtual machines (ports, on-premise, cloud)

    4.Network 
        Limit communication between resources using segmentation and access controls 

    5.Perimeter
        distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection 
        to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users 

    6.Identity and access 
        Controlling access to infrastructure and change control 

    7.Physical 
        limiting access to a datacenter to only authorized personnel

    -You launch on Azure Firewall in its on VNet 
    -Other VNets pass through this Central VNet 
    -You get MICROSOFT THREAT INTELLIGENCE 
        Blocks know malicious IPs and FQDNs 


==Application Gateway==
    APPLICATION LEVEL-ROUTING and LOAD BALANCING service 
    (Operates on OSI layer 7 -> Application Layer)

    -Application Gateway UNDERSTAND HOW TO WORK WITH HTTP/S requests
    -Advanced routing rules based on the contents of a request

    -AZURE WEB APPLICATION FIREWALL (WAF) policies can be attached to an 
    APPLICATION GATEWAY to provide additional security 

    Configure:
        FRONTENDS -> ROUTING RULES -> BACKEND POOLS     

    =Frontends=
        -Private IP will create an Internal Load Balancer 
        -Public IP will create a Public/External Load Balancer 

    =Backends=
        -Backend Pools 
            Collection of resources to which your application Gateway can send traffic
        
        =Can contain:
            -Virtual machines 
            -Virtual machines Scale sets 
            -IP addresses 
            -IP domain names 
            -App service

    =Routing Rules=
        -Listeners
            List to incoming traffic and passes it to rules 

        -Rules 
            Say who should we pass data to 

        HTTP/S settings 
            say how we should handle HTTP requests


==Routing rules==   
    =Listener=
        "Listens" specified port and IP address for traffic that uses a specified protocol 
        (If criteria are met, the application gateway will apply this routing rule)

        =2 types of listeners=
            1.Basic 
                Forward all requests for any domain to backend pools 
            2.Multi-site 
                Forward requests to different backend pools based on HOST READER and HOST NAME 

        -Requests are matched according to ORDER OF RULES and type of listener 
            -Add basic listeners last otherwise it will capture all requests-

    =Backend Targets=
        Chooses where a route should go either BACKEND POOL or REDIRECTION 

    =HTTP SETTINGS=
        To create a rule for backend Pool you need to create HTTP setting 
        Allows to define how we want to handle cookies, connection draining, port request time out and more

    =Backend Port=
        Port where the backend servers listen to incoming traffic

    =Cookie based affinity=
        Use cookies to keep user session on the same server

    =Connection draining=
        Gracefully remove backend pool members during planned services updates 

    =Request Timeouts=
        Number of seconds that the application gateway will wait to receive a response 
        from the backend pools before it returns a "connection timed out" error message

    =Override backend path=
        Override the path in the URL so that the requests for a specific path 
        can be routed to another path

    =Override Hostname 
        Multi-tentant services like App service or API management rely on 
        a specific host header or SNI extension to resolve to the correct endpoint.
        (Change this settings to overwrite the incoming HTTP host header)


==Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)==
    Helps you MANAGE WHO HAS ACCESS TO AZURE RESOURCES, what they can do with those resources
    and what areas they have access to

    =Role assignment=
        The way you control access to resources 
        
        =3 elements=
            1.Security Principal 
                Identity requesting access to an Azure resource such as:

                    -User
                        Individual who has a profile in Azure Active Directory 

                    -Group
                        Set of users created in Azure Active Directory 

                    -Service Principal
                        Security identity used by applications or services to access specific Azure resources
                    
                    -Managed Identity 
                        Identity in Azure Active Directory that is automatically managed by Azure

            2.Role definition
                Collection of permissions
                =OPERATIONS=
                    -Read
                    -Write
                    -Delete 
                    
                    Roles can be high-level like OWNER 
                    Roles can be specific like VIRTUAL MACHINE READER 

                =Azure has BUILT-IN ROLES(4 fundamental built-in roles)
                    -Owner
                    -Contributor 
                    -Reader 
                    -User Access Administrator
                
                and you can define CUSTOM ROLES= 

            3.Scope
                Set of resources that access for the Role assignment applies to.
                Scope Access Controls at the MANAGEMENT, SUBSCRIPTION or RESOURCE GROUP LEVEL.


        =4 FUNDAMENTAL AZURE ROLES= (Azure RBAC includes over 70 built-in roles)

==Management Groups==
    Managing multiple subscriptions (accounts) into a hierarchal structure

    -Each directory is given a single top-level management group called ROOT management group 

    -All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied 
    to the management group


==Service Health==
    Information about CURRENT AND UPCOMING ISSUES such as:
        -Service impacting events

            -Relationship between the BLUEPRINT DEFINITION(what should be deployed)
            and BLUEPRINT ASSIGNMENT (what was deployed)

            -Can also upgrade several subscriptions at once that are governed by the 
            same blueprint

    =AZURE BLUEPRINTS SUPPORTS IMPROVED TRACKING AND AUDITING OF DEPLOYMENTS=   

15.Azure Management Tools 

==Azure Portal==
    -WEB-BASED, UNIFIED CONSOLE that provides an alternative 
    to command-line tools.(Browser to use Azure)

    -Manage your subscription 

    -BUILD, MANAGE AND MONITOR everything from simple web apps 
    to complex cloud deployments 

    =Azure Preview Portal=
        You can utilize new features that are in:
            -Preview
            -Beta 
            -Other pre-release

        -TEST PREVIEW FEATURES -> preview.portal.azure.com 
        -STABLE-RELEASE AND PRODUCTION-READY FEATURES -> portal.azure.com

==Cloud Shell==
    -Interactive, authenticated, BROWSER-ACCESIBLE SHELL for managing 
    Azure resources 

    Provides flexibility of choosing the shell experience that 
    best suits the way you work (Bash or PowerShell)


==PowerShell==
    -Task automation and configuration management framework.
    COMMAND-LINE SHELL and a SCRIPTING-LANGUAGE

    POWERSHELL is built on top of the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR)
    ,and then accepts and returns .NET objects


==Azure CLI==
    -CLI:
        Command Line Inteface(CLI)
            PROCESSES COMMANDS TO A COMPUTER PROGRAM IN THE FORM OF 
            LINES OF TEXT.

            Operating systems implement a command-line inteface 
            in a shell or terminal 

    -The AZURE CLI can be installed on Windows, Mac and Linux.
    (Once installed you can type 'az' followed by other commands to 
    CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, VIEW and MANAGE Azure resources)

==Visual Studio Code==
    -FREE SOURCE CODE EDITOR made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS


==Introduction to Azure Resource Manager(ARM)==   
    -Service that allows you to MANAGE Azure resources 

    -Collection of services in the Azure Portal, SO YOU CAN'T SIMPLY TYPE
    in "Azure Resource Manager"

    =Management layer that allows to:
        -Create, Update, Delete resources 
        -Apply management features (Access controls, Locks, tags)
        -Writing infrastructure as Code (IaC) via JSON templates 

        =Features that make up the ARM LAYER=
            -Subscriptions 
            -Management Groups 
            -Resource Groups 
            -Resource Providers

            -Role Based Acess Control (RBAC)
            -Azure policies 
            -ARM templates 

==ARM (use cases)==
    -Think of ARM as a GATEKEEPER 
        (All REQUESTS flow through ARM and it decides whether that 
        request can be performed on a RESOURCE)


==Azure Resource Manager(scope)==   
    =Scope=
        BOUNDARY OF CONTROL for Azure resources.
        Way to GOVERN your resource by placing resources
            -Withing a local grouping 
            -Applying logical restrictions in the form of rules 

    =Scopes=
        -Management Groups
            Logical grouping of multiple subscriptions 

            -Subscriptions 
                Grants access to Azure services based on billing and 
                support agreement 

                -Resource group
                    Logical grouping of multiple resources 

                    -Resources 
                        An Azure service (eg.Azure VMs)
        

==Introduction to ARM templates==
    =Infrastructure AS Code(IaC)=
        -Process of MANAGING AND PROVISIONING computer data centers(Azure)
        through machine-readable DEFINITION FILES(Json Files) rather than 
        physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools 

    (Write script that will setup cloud services for you)

    IaCs can be:
        -Declarative:
            Defined exactly what you want, and you get exactly that 

        -Imperative:
            Defined what you generally want, and the 
            service will guess what you want 

    =ARM Templates=
        -JSON FILE THAT DEFINE AZURE RESOURCES you want to provision and 
        Azure services you want to configure

            -ARM Templates are declarative (You get exactly what you define)

            -Stand up, tear down or share entire architectures in minutes 

            -Reduce configuration mistakes 

            -Know exactly what you have defined for a stack to establish
            an architecture baseline for compliance 

            -MODULARITY -> Break up your architecture in multiple files
            and reuse them 

            -EXTENSIBILIY -> Add PowerShell and Bash scripts to your templates 

            -TESTING -> Use the ARM template tool kit (arm-ttk)

            -PREVIEW CHANGES -> Before you create infrastructure via 
            template, see what it will create 

            -BUILT-IN VALIDATION -> Will only deploy your template if it passes 

            -TRACKED DEPLOYMENTS -> Keep track of changes to architecture over time 

            -POLICY AS CODE -> Apply Azure policies to ensure you remain compliant 

            -MICROSOFT BLUEPRINTS -> Establishes relationship between resource and 
            template 

            -CI/CD Integration (Continuous Integration/Continous Deploy)

            -EXPORTABLE CODE -> Exporting current state of a resource groups 
            and resource 

            -Authoring tools -> Visual Studio Code has advanced features 
            for authoring ARM templates


16. Monitoring Tools 

==Introduction to Azure Monitor==

    ON TELEMETRY from your cloud and on-premises environments 

    -Create visual Dashboards 
    -Smart alerts 
    -Automated Actions 
    -Log monitoring 
    (Many Azure services by default are already sending telemetry data to 
    Azure Monitor)


==Pillars of Observability==
    =Observability=
        -ability to measure and understand how internal systems
        work in order to answer questions regarding performance, 
        tolerance, security, and faults with a system/application 

        -To gain observability you need:

            -Metrics 
                -Number that is measured over period of time 
                (If we measured the CPU usage and aggerated it over 
                an a period of time we could have an AVERAGE CPU METRIC)

            -Logs
                -Text file where each line contains event data about what 
                happened at a certain time

            -Traces
                -History of requests that travels through multiple 
                APPS / SERVICES  so we can pinpoint performance or failure


==Anatomy of Azure Monitor==
    -SOURCES OF COMMON MONITORING DATA to populate datastores  
    (Order by (Highest to Lowest))

==Log analytics==
    -Tool in the Azure Portal used TO EDIT AND RUN LOG QUERIES 
    with data in Azure Monitor Logs 
    (Uses query language called KQL)


==Log analytics Workspaces==
    =Workspace=
        -Unique environment for Azure Monitor Log data 

    -Has its own repository and configuration
    -Data sources and solutions are configured to store their data in 
    a particular WORKSPACE


==Azure Alerts==
    -Notify when issues are found with your infrastructure or application 
    (Allow to IDENTIFY and ADDRESS issues before the users of your 
    system notice them)

    =3 Kinds of alerts:
        -Metric alerts 
        -Log alerts 
        -Activity Log alerts

    (When an alerts is triggered you can be notified and have it take action)


    =Alert rule=
        -defines who should we monitor and when should we react 

    =Target Resource=
        -A resource such as VM is designated as the TARGET RESOURCE 
        and it omits a SIGNAL 

    =Signal=
        -Data payload emmited from the resource that could be:
            -Metric 
            -Log 
            -Activity Log 
            -Application Insights 


    =Criteria/logic test=
        -Signal is evaluated against a CRITERIA OR LOGICAL TEST to determine 
        if the alerts has been triggered (Percentage CPU > 70%)


    =Action group=
        -Contains actions to be that will performed when alert is triggered 

    =Actions=
        (Automation runbook, Azure Function, ITSM, Logic App, Webhooks or Secure Webhooks)

    =Monitor condition=
        (Current state of your alert)
        - Set by the system 

    =Alert State= 
        -Set by the user

==Application insights==
    -APPLICATION PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT (APM) service 
    (It is a sub-service of Azure Monitor)


    =APM= 
        -Monitoring and management of PERFORMANCE AND AVAILABILITY 
        of software apps.

        -Detect and diagnose complex application performance problems to 
        maintaing an expected level of service 

        =Why use them?=
            -Automatically detect performance anomalies 

            -Includes powerful analytics tools that help diagnose 
            issues and to understand what users do with your app

            -designed to help you continuosly improve performance 
            and usability 

            -works for apps on a for .NET, Node.js, Java, and Python hosted 
            On-premises ,hybrid, or any public cloud 

            -Integrated with DEVOPS process 

            -Monitor and analyze telemetry from mobile apps by integrating 
            with Visual Studio App Center 

        
    -To use application insights YOU NEED TO INSTRUMENT YOUR APPLICATION 
        -Install instrument package (SDK)
        
        -Enable application insights using the Application insights 
        Agents when supported 

        -Apps can be instrumented from anywhere 

        -When you set up Application insights monitoring for your 
        web app, you create an Application insights resource in 
        Microsoft Azure 

        -You open this resource in the Azure portal in order to see 
        and analyze the telemetry collected from your app
