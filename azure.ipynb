in a remote server that is hosted on the internet, so that you can store, \\nmanage, and procees data ,rather than a local server or PC (someone else does the server job)\\n-someone owns the server\\n-someone hires the IT people\\n-someone pays or rents real-estate\\n-You configure your cloud services and code, someone else does the rest\\n\\n=Evolution of cloud hosting=\\n1995 - Dedicated server\\nOne Physical machine dedicated to single a business\\n-runs a single web-app/site\\n(Very expensive, high maintenance, *High security)\\n\\nVirtual Private server (VPS)\\nOne Physical machine dedicated to a single business (virtualized into submachines)\\n-Runs multiple web-apps/sites\\n(Better utilization and Isolation of resources)\\n\\nShared Hosting (GoDaddy)\\nOne Physical machine, shared by hundred of business \\n-Relies on most tenants under-utlizing their resources\\n(Very Cheap, limited functionality , Poor isolation)\\n\\nCloud hosting\\nMultiple physical machines (act as one system)\\n-Abstracted into multiple cloud services\\n(Flexible, Scalable, Secure, Cost-effective, High configurability)\\n\\n\\n==Common cloud Services==\\nA cloud provider can have hundreds of cloud services \\n(grouped into types of services)\\n\\n=Four most common types of cloud services for InfrastructureAsAService(IaaS)=\\n\\n-Compute\\nVirtual Computer that can run application, programs and code\\n\\n-Storage\\nVirtual hard-drive that can store files\\n\\n-Networking\\nVirtual network being able to define internet connections or Network

anywhere in the world, just choose region\\n\\n-Secure\\n    Cloud provider takes care of physical security.\\n    Can be secure by default or you can configure access down to granular level\\n\\n-Reliable \\n    Data backup, disaster recovery, data replication, fault tolerance\\n\\n-Scalable \\n    Increase or decrease recources and services based on demand\\n\\n-Elastic\\n    Automate scaling during spikes and drop in demand\\n\\n-Current \\n    Hardware and managed sofware is patched ,upgraded and replaced by cloud provider \\n    (without interruptions, or few interruptions)\\n\\n\\n==Types of cloud computing==\\nSoftware As A Service (SaaS)\\n    - Product that is run and managed by the service Provider\\n    (Don\\'t need to worry about how the service is maintained, just remains available)\\n    -SalesForce, Gmail, Office 365\\n\\nPlatform As A Service (PaaS)\\n    - Focus on deployment and management of your apps\\n    (Don\\'t worry about

credentials, utilizing their \\n            CURRENT WINDOWS SESSION for authentication \\n\\n        -Header Based authentication:\\n            The application accepts an authentication token in the form of a header in each \\n            request \\n            (Token validated by the application to authenticate the user)\\n\\n    =Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)=\\n        -Security control

\\n\\n==Conditional Access==\\n    -Provides extra layer of security before allowing authenticated users to access data or other assets \\n\\n    -Implemented via CONDITIONAL ACCESS POLIICES \\n    (Set of rules that specify the CONDITIONS under which sign-ins are EVALUATED and ALLOWED)\\n\\n    Ex:\\n        if the user account name is a member of a group for users that are assigned the \\n            EXCHANGE, USER, PASSWORD, SECURITY, SHAREPOINT , OR GLOBAL ADMINISTRATOR ROLES:\\n                Require MFA before allowing access\\n\\n            (Policy enables MFA enforcement based on

sign-in risk detection\\n            Sigals in Azure AD identity protection detect risky sign-ins \\n            IF risk emerge , policies can prompt actions such as\\n                -Password
